# Descriptive-Answer-Checking

A standalone application to check descriptive answers. Human-like evaluation is done on the basis of three criteria like:
1. Word Length
2. Keyword Extraction
3. Grammar Checking

Our system extracts keywords using the RAKE Algorithm.
Grammar Checking is done by using the Grammar-Check tool in Python.

Every criteria is seperately scored and is cumulatively calculated to give the final result.
